## Abstract

We present GDSFactory, an open-source Python library for integrated circuit design automation supporting photonics, analog, quantum, and MEMS applications. The platform provides unified workflows spanning layout design, device simulation through FDTD (MEEP, Tidy3D, Lumerical), FEM (Femwell), and TCAD (DEVSIM) solvers, and circuit simulation via SAX S-parameter analysis.

## 1. Introduction

Hardware iterations typically require months and millions of dollars, while software iterations cost hundreds of dollars and take hours. GDSFactory bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive Python API for chip development, including layout design, device simulation, circuit simulation, and verification [1].

Unlike constrained logic-driven electronic design flows [2], integrated photonics requires freeform parametric geometries and tight integration between layout and electromagnetic simulation. GDSFactory addresses this with scriptable parametric cells (PCells), hierarchical assembly, routing, and seamless interfaces to industry-standard simulators---all in Python's extensive scientific ecosystem (Fig. 1).

## 2. Layout Design

GDSFactory implements cells as Python functions returning a `Component` class with polygons, port metadata, and convenience methods. Using KLayout's C++ geometry engine [3], users define PCells with a functional programming approach:

## 3. Device Simulation

GDSFactory's gplugins repository provides unified interfaces to device simulators by reusing layout abstractions. Components can be meshed via GMSH for cross-sectional or 3D analysis (Fig. 3).

### 3.1 FDTD Simulation

Full-wave electromagnetic simulation is supported through open-source FDTD backends:

- **MEEP** [4]: Open-source FDTD solver for computing transmission spectra, field profiles, and S-parameters. GDSFactory automatically generates simulation regions, sources, and monitors from component geometry.
- **Luminescent AI**: Open-source Python wrapper providing simplified FDTD workflows with automatic meshing and optimization capabilities.

And proprietary FDTD solvers:

- **Tidy3D** [5]: Cloud-based proprietary FDTD with GPU acceleration enabling rapid parametric sweeps. The interface handles geometry export, material mapping, and result retrieval.
- **Lumerical FDTD**: Proprietary FDTD supporting automated scripting and result import.

### 3.2 FEM and Multiphysics Solvers

- **Femwell** [6]: Open-source FEM solver for waveguide mode analysis, thermal simulation, and electro-optic modeling. Computes effective indices, group indices, and mode overlaps directly from GDSFactory cross-sections.
- **Palace** [8]: Open-source FEM solver from AWS for high-speed RF and microwave simulations. Supports eigenmode analysis, frequency-domain driven simulations, and electrostatic/magnetostatic problems for modeling transmission lines, RF interconnects, and electro-optic modulators at microwave frequencies.
- **MPB**: MIT Photonic Bands for photonic crystal and periodic structure analysis.
- **MEOW**: Eigenmode expansion (EME) for propagation through adiabatic tapers and mode converters.

### 3.3 TCAD Simulation

- **DEVSIM** [7]: Open-source TCAD for semiconductor device physics, enabling carrier transport and electro-optic modulator simulation. GDSFactory exports doped regions and contacts directly to DEVSIM meshes.
- **Sentaurus**: Commercial TCAD integration for advanced process and device simulation.

## 4. Circuit Simulation

Circuit-level simulation enables system-scale photonic design through netlist extraction and S-parameter composition.

### 4.1 SAX S-Parameter Analysis

SAX [9] provides differentiable S-parameter circuit simulation using JAX. GDSFactory extracts hierarchical netlists from layouts, associating each component with its S-parameter model:

SAX supports:
- Automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization
- Montecarlo analysis for yield estimation
- Wavelength-dependent S-parameter interpolation from FDTD results

### 4.2 SPICE Integration

VLSIR provides SPICE netlist export for mixed photonic-electronic simulation, enabling co-simulation with control electronics.

## 5. Process Design Kits

GDSFactory supports a wide range of open-source and commercial PDKs. Each PDK includes layer definitions, design rules, and validated component models for circuit simulation, following standard layer conventions [11] for cross-foundry compatibility.
